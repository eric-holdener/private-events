Private Events

This project is designed to model an event website similar to how Eventbrite operates.

A user can create events and also attend events. Events can be attended by multiple users, and take place at a specific date and location.

This project is laid out by The Odin Project here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events

It is designed to make me think more about my database relationships, how to model them, and how to work with them within the context of rails and the active record. This is the first time I will have been required to create and maintain a many to many relationship in teh context of my projects.
